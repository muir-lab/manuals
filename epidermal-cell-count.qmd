## Purpose

Estimate number of epidermal cells per area from light microscope images using [FIJI](https://imagej.net/software/fiji/).

## Prerequisites

-   Install [FIJI](https://imagej.net/software/fiji/)

## Steps

### 1. Open FIJI from Dock

### 2. Open image for measurements

### 3. Configure multi-point tool options

-   right-click on multi-point tool button in the FIJI tool bar

- Select the following options: 

  + Type: Dot 
  + Color: Yellow 
  + Size: Extra large

-   Click "OK" button when properly configured

### 4. Open ROI manager

-   ROI stands for "Region of Interest"
-   This enables you to save your work so you can stop and restart and we can verify work later
-   Select "Analyze \> Tools \> ROI Manager..."

## PAUSE and read carefully

If you are starting a new image, keep reading below. If you are restarting counts on an image you have already begun, skip down to "Restarting images".

## Starting new images

### 5. Count epidermal cells

- Check that multi-point tool is selected
- Place a point (yellow dot) in every epidermal (see example below)
  + Left-clicking mouse in an empty region will place a new point
  + Do not place a point in stomata, trichomes, etc.
  + Include partial cells cut off by edge
  + Do your best in regions that are out of focus
  + Use the Zoom tool as needed to focus on smaller regions
- You can fix mistakes by moving around individual points with your mouse
- Example:

### 6. Save your work

- When you are ready to save your work, add points to ROI manager by clicking "Add [t]" button or pressing "t" on the keyboard

- To save, select "More > Save..." in the ROI Manager

- Save using the image file name, but with ".roi" instead of ".tif" extension

### 7. Enter final cell count and notes in Excel spreadsheet

- **Label**: image file name (exclude the ".tif" extension)
- **n**: epidermal cell count
- **notes**: any notes on image quality or concerns

Save spreadsheet

## Restarting images

### 8. Open and update saved ROI

- To open, select "More > Open..." in the ROI Manager

- Continue counting epidermal cells
- To update the ROI, make sure ROI is selected and press "Update" in ROI Manager
