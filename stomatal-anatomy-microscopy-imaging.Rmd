### 1. Prepare

1.1 Find a mold folder and take out one working page.  

1.2 Open the data file and find the number of the page.  

For quantity test:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/166n-3RT2ai1lQwvxABFdsAe6WKWF4I5sx1N6Zqs4soU/edit?usp=drive_link

#where is the datasheet for each garden?

1.3 Open a blank page and record the same number on both two sides and all other information from the working page to the blank page. 

1.4 Move all samples on side of the working page and place them in the preparation area (a shallow, gridded slab, or a plastic tray) according to their numbers. 

1.5 Check that the sample is clean, could use paper towels to clean the surface. 

### 2.Nail Polish 

2.1 Open a bottle of nail polish and make sure the brush is clean and tidy first.  

2.2 Apply an even coat of nail polish to each mold and put them back to the working place. 

2.3 Wait for drying, about 5 minutes. 

2.4 Apply the dried nail polish with tape and remove it from the mold 

2.5 Apply tape and nail polish to the slide, make it flat.


### 3. Use a microscope to take stomatal images.  

3.1. Computer and microscope 

  3.1.1 If the microscope has a cover, remove it carefully. 

  3.1.2 Open the light of the microscope.  

  3.1.3 Open the console power. 

  3.1.4 Turn the objective lens to 10X. 

  3.1.5 Open the NIS-Elements soft work on the computer.  

3.2. Observation and Imaging 

  3.2.1 Place the prepared slide on the observation stage 

  3.2.2 Open live observation (Green arrow button) 

![](images/stomatal image computer/image 1)
  3.2.3 Open the AE control if not (Auto light control) 

 ![](images/stomatal image computer/image 2)

  3.2.4 Adjust focus and position to find the right, clear image 

      Easy to see the stomata 

      The image should be bright, clear and accurate focus 

      Not a lot of bubbles or trichomes 

 	    Resolution is 1280X960


3.3 Use capture button take photo. 

![](images/stomatal image computer/image 3)

 
  3.3.1 Use file label save image to the computer desktop 

  3.3.2 The file format is JEPG 

  3.3.3 Naming: 2023 North-801-06-upper 

    YYYY_region_row_col_surface 

    OR 

    YYYY_region_row_col_surface_rep 

    Use _ or -, no whitespace 

    Always use lowercase 

    Column – always use three digits 

  Examples: 

    2023_north_101_001_upper 

    2023_north_101_001_upper_1 

 


### 4. Final work  

  4.1 Upload the all images to the folder. 

  For quantity test:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rGSGvlBm00Ye6gKyBNPd3TnKy1ifnGRN?usp=drive_link
  
  For other data:

  North 2023:https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Y4d_mS67HFyicTvW2c8bdpv8SuKld3cf?usp=drive_link

  South 2023：https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iYK1C87dMIz8_xLXEpZffssG0rSQFYPU?usp=drive_link

  4.2 Report the image information on the data file, including the time and name of the sampler.
  
  4.3 Place the completed molds on a blank recording paper, secure them with tape again, and put it back to the folder. 

  4.4 Remove the tape and clean the slide with ethanol for next time. 

  4.5 Used tape can be thrown directly into the trash can 

  4.6 When done for the day, put all slides back to the box 

  4.7 Close the computer console, turn off the microscope light, and put the cover back 

 
### Precautions 

If the microscope is not used for a long time, turn off the power 

Don't disturb other people's work.
